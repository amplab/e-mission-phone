    The value for the connect_url depends on the way in which you are running the phone app and the server.

    The following table can provide a quick summary:
    phone app | server | hostname
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    emulator  | laptop | 10.0.2.2 or <IP address of laptop>
    genymotion| laptop | 10.0.3.2 or <IP address of laptop>
    device    | laptop | <IP address of laptop>
    *         | server | server IP

    IP address of laptop is the output of "ifconfig" or "ipconfig".

    In order to make it easier for developers to perform end-to-end testing, we skip authentication in development mode,
    both on the server and on the client.
    This needs to be CHANGED before working with any kind of real data over the wire.
    DO NOT collect or transmit real data without authentication.
    That is a terrible data and your IRB will hate you for it.

    Note that this is the value listed under "Client ID for web application" -> "Client ID". Do NOT use
    the client ID for the android app or the client secret
